# Networking Project

## Idea/Vision
Coming soon

### Roadmap:
- _Make up your mind for going though this journey! Very Important!_
- Read [this](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/howcomputernetworkswork.html) and get basic idea about LAN/WAN/etc networks!
- Know how a workstation communicates, ie the era of IP addressing! [link here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ipv4/ipv4_quick_guide.htm)
- Try to understand what could be made under network project! Try [reading this](https://projectsgeek.com/networking-projects-computer-science)
- Read about tools/commands to pentest networks! [Please ping me](https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/networking-tutorials/basic-networking-commands-explained-with-examples.html)
- **Checkpoint 1: Connect two workstation to EACCESS and trying ping-ing the local-ipv4 address of other workstation!**
- Network programming, click [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_networking.htm) for python and [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/) for C++!
- **Mini-project 1: Create a very basic echo client/server! (Hosted and used in local machines only)**
- (Optional) Read [Beej's guide to network programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/), one of the best-est books for networking!! But little heavy and lot in-depth, not needed to read everything but this is a very good book!
- **Mini-project 2: Create basic chat-application using concepts of network programming, reading beej's guide if required!**
- Read about different kind of servers and their uses, [link here](https://www.networkstraining.com/different-types-of-servers/)
- **Checkpoint 2: Host simple FTP server and access it from another workstation, both connected to EACCESS!**
- (Fun Read) [Read my blog post detailing the in's and out's of thapar wifi, EACCESS!](http://withme.skullzbones.com/blog/programming/revelations-about-the-thapar-wifi-and-the-utilities-regarding-them-eaccess-tu-lc-etc/) Try practically doing Revelation 1! _Highly recommended as it will be lot useful in future!_
- **Checkpoint 3: ARP Poison your friend's PC and scare him with his search history** (Little difficult, take help if needed)
- More coming soon
